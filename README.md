# flockers
===
An implementation of flocking behavior in boids exhibiting separation, alignment, and cohesion plus some extras.

##Usage
- Clone repository.
- Open a command prompt, navigate to the /Skeleton folder
- $ java Simulation ../Examples/<Enter an .xml>
- /Examples contains several world simulations in which boids interact under a set of given conditions. 

##Demo:

Basic flocking and target-affinity behavior with force vectors visible.

More examples to be added if I am bored enough.
Check out celebrity.xml.  It implements crowd chasing behavior.
