# flockers
===
An implementation of flocking behavior in boids exhibiting separation, alignment, and cohesion plus some extras.

##Usage
- Clone repository.
- Open a command prompt, navigate to the /Skeleton folder
- $ java Simulation ../Examples/ Choose an .xml
- /Examples contains several world simulations in which boids interact under a set of given conditions. 

##Demo:

Basic flocking and target-affinity behavior with force vectors visible.

Debugging light chasing behavior.

Example of the disadvantages of simple behaviors.  Boids are unable to reach the light due to repulsive forces.

More examples to be added if I am bored enough.
Check out celebrity.xml.  It implements crowd chasing behavior.
